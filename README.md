# Astrosage Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This repository contains a complete sales analysis project for Astrosage. The goal was to analyze historical sales data to identify trends, top-performing areas, and opportunities for growth. The entire analysis—from data cleaning to visualization—was conducted using Microsoft Excel, and the final insights were compiled into a business-ready PowerPoint presentation.
